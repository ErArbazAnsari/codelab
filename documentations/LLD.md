# Low-Level Design (LLD) Document

## Overview
This document provides a detailed low-level design for the Codelab application, covering the key components, their interactions, and the overall architecture.

## Components
1. **User Authentication**
   - Handles user registration, login, and authentication.
   - Utilizes JWT for secure token-based authentication.

2. **Problem Creation**
   - Allows users to create and manage coding problems.
   - Supports various problem types and difficulty levels.

3. **Submission Handling**
   - Manages code submissions from users.
   - Integrates with external APIs for code evaluation.

4. **AI Chatting**
   - Provides an AI-powered chat interface for user queries.
   - Utilizes NLP techniques for understanding user intent.

5. **Video Creation**
   - Allows users to create and edit instructional videos.
   - Supports video uploads and processing.

6. **Bookmarks**
   - Enables users to bookmark important resources.
   - Provides a personalized dashboard for quick access.

7. **Discussions**
   - Facilitates discussions around coding problems.
   - Supports threaded comments and notifications.

8. **Statistics**
   - Provides insights into user performance and engagement.
   - Utilizes data visualization techniques for reporting.

## Architecture
The Codelab application follows a microservices architecture, with each component being developed and deployed independently. The key services include:

- **Auth Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Problem Service**: Handles all operations related to coding problems.
- **Submission Service**: Manages code submissions and evaluations.
- **AI Service**: Provides AI-powered features and functionalities.
- **Video Service**: Handles video creation and processing.
- **Bookmark Service**: Manages user bookmarks and preferences.
- **Discussion Service**: Facilitates discussions and community interactions.
- **Stats Service**: Provides analytics and reporting capabilities.

## Data Flow
1. User interacts with the frontend application.
2. Frontend sends requests to the appropriate backend services.
3. Services communicate with each other via REST APIs or message queues.
4. Data is stored in a centralized database, with caching layers for performance.

## Conclusion
This low-level design document serves as a blueprint for the development of the Codelab application. It outlines the key components, their interactions, and the overall architecture, providing a solid foundation for implementation.
